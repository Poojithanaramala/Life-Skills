# Preventing Sexual Harassment

## 1. What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can happen when someone:

- **Makes unwanted moves:** Touching or flirting that is not wanted.
- **Tells sexual jokes:** Making jokes that make people uncomfortable.
- **Comments on looks:** Saying things about someone’s appearance that they don’t like.
- **Talks about private stuff:** Bringing up sexual topics when it’s not okay.
- **Is mean:** Bullying or scaring others.
- **Gets back at people:** Punishing someone for saying no or reporting harassment.

## 2. What would you do if you see or experience this behavior?
If I see or experience sexual harassment, I would:

- **Write it down:** Note what happened, when, and where.
- **Speak up:** If safe, tell the person to stop.
- **Tell someone:** Report it to a manager or HR for help.
- **Support others:** Help anyone who is being harassed and encourage them to speak up.
- **Ask for help:** Talk to someone I trust if I’m unsure.
